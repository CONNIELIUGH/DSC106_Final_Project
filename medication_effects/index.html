                    <h2>Understanding Sleep Medication Effects</h2>
                    <p>Sleep medications are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, yet their effects on sleep architecture remain poorly understood by the general public. This interactive story explores how temazepam, a common sleep aid, fundamentally changes the way we sleep.</p>
                    <p>Using data from a controlled clinical trial of 22 subjects, we'll journey through the measurable differences between natural sleep and medicated sleep.</p>

                            <h3>The Clinical Trial</h3>
                            <p>Our study followed 22 participants over multiple nights, comparing their sleep patterns on two different occasions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Placebo night:</strong> Natural sleep with no active medication</li>
                                <li><strong>Temazepam night:</strong> Sleep aided by 15-30mg of temazepam</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Each participant was monitored using polysomnography (sleep study equipment) to capture detailed brain activity, eye movements, and muscle tension throughout the night.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Step 2: Sleep Efficiency -->
                    <div class="step" data-step="efficiency">
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h3>Dramatic Improvement in Sleep Efficiency</h3>
                            <p>Sleep efficiency measures how much of your time in bed is actually spent sleeping. It's one of the most important indicators of sleep quality.</p>
                            <p>The results were striking: participants went from an average of <strong>78% sleep efficiency</strong> on placebo nights to <strong>85% efficiency</strong> with temazepam.</p>
                            <p>This 7-percentage-point improvement means spending less time lying awake in bed and more time in restorative sleep.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3>Less Time Awake During the Night</h3>
                            <p>One of the most noticeable effects of temazepam was the reduction in nighttime awakenings.</p>
                            <p>Participants spent an average of <strong>22% of the night awake</strong> on placebo, but only <strong>12% awake</strong> with temazepam.</p>
                            <p>This represents nearly a 50% reduction in wake time – meaning more continuous, uninterrupted sleep throughout the night.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3>Enhanced REM Sleep</h3>
                            <p>REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is crucial for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and emotional processing.</p>
                            <p>Contrary to some medications that suppress REM sleep, temazepam actually enhanced it:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Placebo nights: <strong>18% REM sleep</strong></li>
                                <li>Temazepam nights: <strong>22% REM sleep</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This 4-percentage-point increase suggests better cognitive restoration and emotional regulation.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3>Preserved Deep Sleep</h3>
                            <p>Deep sleep (Stage N3) is essential for physical recovery, immune function, and memory consolidation.</p>
                            <p>Many sleep medications can suppress deep sleep, but temazepam maintained healthy levels:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Placebo: <strong>15% deep sleep</strong></li>
                                <li>Temazepam: <strong>18% deep sleep</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This preservation of deep sleep while improving other metrics makes temazepam particularly effective for overall sleep quality.</p>

                            <p>When we look at the complete picture of sleep stages throughout the night, the benefits of temazepam become clear.</p>
                            <p>The medication doesn't just help you fall asleep – it fundamentally improves the quality and structure of your entire night's rest.</p>
                            <p>Notice how the temazepam pattern shows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Less fragmented sleep</li>
                                <li>More time in beneficial sleep stages</li>
                                <li>Better sleep continuity</li>
                            </ul>

                    </div>

                    <!-- Step 7: Individual Differences -->

                            <h3>Individual Response Patterns</h3>
                            <p>While the treatment showed average improvements, individuals responded quite differently, and what mattered most wasn't age or demographics, but <strong title="How efficiently someone was sleeping before treatment began">baseline sleep quality</strong>.</p>
                            <p>
                                Participants who started with <strong title="Lower initial sleep efficiency gave more room for improvement">poorer baseline sleep</strong> often showed the greatest gains.
                                On the other hand, those who were already sleeping well saw little to no benefit, and in some cases, even a decline.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong title="Those with room to improve benefited more">Poor baseline sleep = larger gains</strong></li>
                                <li><strong title="Little room left for improvement">Good baseline sleep = smaller gains or no change</strong></li>
                                <li><strong title="Sleep is complex and varies by person">Each response was highly individual</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This underscores the value of personalized sleep care — understanding where someone starts helps determine the right treatment approach.</p>
